# HTML & CSS Challenge Two

Your challenge is fix issues with the HTML pages and CSS, add new styles, and publish this challenge to your IU Pages account.

There are multiple HTML and CSS errors in this website. Use the W3C's [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to find errors, and correct them.

In addition to outright errors, there are a handful of style issues. There is a folder named "screenshots" that shows your end goal in multiple sizes. Yes, this is supposed to be a responsive site. Hint: one step to completing this will involve using [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/).

You should use Cyberduck to upload the project to your `www` folder on IU Pages. Viewing this code on IU Pages may help you find issues, particularly those related to URLs.
